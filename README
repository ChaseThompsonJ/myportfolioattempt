# Challenge 2
Deployable Portfolio

## Description
I deployed this website for my first portfolio. This website took me several attempts. It is not perfect.
I remade this website several times on different scales. I plan to resubmit this in the future once I 
under stand the formatting better.

## Task Assigned
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
